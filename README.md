# Facial-emotion-recognition with CNN
This repository contains code and resources for a facial emotion recognition model built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on the FER 2013 dataset. The model classifies images into various emotions, enabling applications in sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and more.

# Project Overview
Facial emotion recognition is a key area in computer vision with applications in psychological research, interactive systems, and social robotics. This project leverages CNN architecture to identify emotions from facial expressions with high accuracy, using the FER 2013 datasetâ€”a widely used benchmark for emotion detection tasks.

# Features
Dataset: FER 2013 dataset containing 35,887 grayscale images of size 48x48 pixels, classified into seven emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral.
Model: CNN architecture optimized for emotion classification.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and F1 score for balanced performance assessment.
Training: Extensive experimentation with hyperparameters for improved generalization.
Visualization: Plotting training/validation accuracy and loss curves, and confusion matrix heatmap.
